# Motivation
This project was created as a result of a joint idea of ​​our team members inspired by the given topic by the professor. The project itself is very similar to the Travel Order theme, which was the default, but we adapted it to our idea.

This repository is based on a [project template](https://github.com/VladoSruk/Programsko-inzenjerstvo) provided by [Associate Professor Vlado Sruk, PhD](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/vlado.sruk). We have modified this template to suit our needs and would like to acknowledge the professor's effort in providing a solid foundation for our project assignment.

## Code of Conduct &ensp;[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

As students, you are likely familiar with the minimum standards of acceptable behavior as defined in the [FER Student Code of Conduct](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/Kodeks_ponasanja_studenata_FER-a_procisceni_tekst_2016[3][1].pdf), as well as additional guidelines for teamwork on the [Software Engineering](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/proinz) course. We expect you to respect the [IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html), which plays an important educational role in establishing the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities. By doing so, the community of software engineers defines common principles that define moral character, making important business decisions, and establishing clear moral expectations for all members of the community.

The Code of Conduct is a set of enforceable rules that serve to clearly communicate expectations and requirements for community/team work. It explicitly defines the obligations, rights, unacceptable behavior, and corresponding consequences (in contrast to an ethical code). A widely accepted Code of Conduct for working in an open-source community has been provided within this repository.
