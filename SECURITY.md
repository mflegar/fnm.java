# Security Policy

We prioritize security and take proactive measures to protect our project from potential vulnerabilities. If you have identified a vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us promptly.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it as a private [security advisory](https://github.com/mflegar/fnm.java/security/advisories/new).
