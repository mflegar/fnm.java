# Contributing

To contribute, clone the repository, make your changes, commit them, push, and submit a pull request.

## Branching Conventions

* All development should occur on branches off of `dev`
* When ready, merge into `dev` using a PR
* The `main` branch is reserved for releases only

## Submitting Changes
